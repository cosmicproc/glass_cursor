        <h2>What is Glass Cursor?</h2>
        <p>See the <a href="./">homepage</a>.</p>
        <h2>Is it private?</h2>
        <p>
            Privacy is integral to Glass Cursor. Glass Cursor doesn't have a
            backend server and completely runs on your browser. You can also
            self-host it if you wish. It's only just static files.
        </p>
        <h2>How can I make it look more like an app?</h2>
        <p>
            If you use a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge) or Safari, you
            can use a feature called progressive web apps (PWAs) to make it look
            more like an app than a webpage. In Chromium-based browsers, there
            should be an icon before the bookmark star icon in the URL bar. You
            can click that to install the webpage as a PWA. In Safari, when on
            the webpage, click to the share button and choose "Add to Home
            Screen" on iOS and "Add to Dock" on macOS.
        </p>
        <h2>Who developed the app?</h2>

            The app is developed by <a href="https://github.com/cosmicproc"
                >Cosmic Process</a
            >. It's open source and the source code available on the
